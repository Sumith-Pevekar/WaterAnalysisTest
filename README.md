# WaterAnalysisTest
This project analyzes the quality of water by training a machine learning model which classifies it as safe and unsafe water for drinking. 
Many factors affect water quality, it is also one of the major research areas in machine learning.


Out of all the algorithms, the Random Forest Classifier algorithm works best for training a machine learning model for the task of water quality analysis. 
So the model is trained with Random Forest Classifier algorithm which is then used to make predictions.
